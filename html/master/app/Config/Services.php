 * framework to be swapped out easily without affecting the usage within
 * the rest of your application.
 *
 * This file holds any application-specific services, or service overrides
 * that you might need. An example has been included with the general
 * method format you should use for your service methods. For more examples,
 * see the core Services file at system/Config/Services.php.
